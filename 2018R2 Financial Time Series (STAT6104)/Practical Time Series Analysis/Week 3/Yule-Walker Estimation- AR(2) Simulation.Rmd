```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

xt=phi1*x(t-1)+phi2*x_(t-2)+z_t z_t~ N(0, sigma^2)
## set seed a common number, so we can reproduce the same datasets

```{r }
set.seed(2017)
```

## model parameters (we will estimate them)

```{r}
sigma=4
phi=NULL
phi[1:2]=c(1/3,1/2)
phi
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
